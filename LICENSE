                      Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in "free speech," not as in "free beer."

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the software, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that commercial users of a free program may be required to pay royalties for using it. To prevent this, the GPL ensures that any patent licenses granted for a program apply to all users of that program, not just those who have paid for it.
